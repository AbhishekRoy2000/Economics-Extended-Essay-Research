# Research Description

Research conducted under Dr. Charu Srivastava to find out the Home Insurance market structure in India. This is an industry that is highly underpenetrated, with a variety of social and economic forces surrounding the Indian consumer's response to the concept of insurance as a whole. 

A surrogate model was created using existing public domain data on market share and revenue of major Indian insurance providers. Primary data collected through a survey and an interview were used to add credence to the findings of the analysis. Factors like HHI, heterogeneity of products, and market data were studied to find the highly competetive nature of the industry.
